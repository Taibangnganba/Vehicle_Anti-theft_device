ABSTRACT

The proposed anti-theft device for vehicles presents a comprehensive solution aimed at enhancing security, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Leveraging a combination of advanced technologies including RFID, accelerometer, GPS, and GSM modules, the device offers three levels of safety to safeguard against vehicle theft. 
At the first level of security, RFID technology is employed for authentication purposes. By checking for the presence of a specific code from an authorized tag, the device selectively grants ignition permission. Any absence of the desired code maintains the ignition line in an off state, effectively preventing unauthorized access. 
Moving to the second level of security, an accelerometer is utilized to detect any movement of the vehicle. This feature acts as a secondary line of defence giving additional security measures upon detecting suspicious activity, thereby thwarting potential theft attempts. 
The third and final level of security integrates GPS and GSM modules into the device. This combination enables real-time tracking of the vehicle's location and facilitates communication with the owner in the event of any security breach. By notifying the owner of the vehicle's whereabouts via a phone call and providing the current location, this feature not only enhances security but also offers peace of mind to the owner. 
We Tested on a two-wheeler scooter (Activa) over several weeks with positive results, the proposed device demonstrates its practicality and efficiency in real-world scenarios. Its successful implementation underscores its potential utility for a wide range of vehicles, making it a valuable asset in reducing the risk of theft and loss. 
Moreover, beyond its immediate benefits, the project serves as an inspiration for future developers to engage in similar endeavour. By sharing insights and experiences gained from the development and deployment of the anti-theft device, the project encourages further innovation in vehicle security, ultimately contributing to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the risk of vehicle theft and enhance overall safety.
